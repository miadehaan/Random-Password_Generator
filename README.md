Random Password Generator

About:

This application prompts the user for specific criteria and generates a random password. The criteria includes the desired length of the password and if they would like to include: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numberic values, and/or special characters. 

```

Instructions:

The code ensures that the user inputs a valid character length between 8-128. If the user inputs a value outside of that range, an alert is displayed telling the user to refresh and input a valid length. Similarly, the user is also required to select at least one character type in order for the password generator to work. An alert is displayed if the user does not select one and instructs them to refresh the page and select at least one. Once the user provides valid responses, the user can press the button on the screen to generate a new password. The button can be repeatedly pressed to generate new passwords with the same original criteria. If new criteria is desired, the page has to be refreshed. 

```
Code:

This code utlizes Javascript's for-loops, if-else statements, and functions in order to make the page interactive and fuctional.
